[ROUND_1_CURL_ONLY]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

The CLI tool should:
1. Accept command-line arguments for the API parameters
2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of the file

Also write comprehensive pytest tests for your CLI tool. The tests should:
1. Test the main functionality by calling the REAL API with valid inputs
2. Test error handling with invalid inputs (if safe to do so)
3. Verify that the CLI correctly parses and displays real API responses
4. DO NOT use mocks or fake data - call the actual API endpoints
5. Include ALL necessary imports (pytest, requests, etc.)

IMPORTANT:
- Make sure to include ALL imports needed for the code to run. Do not assume any imports are already present.
- Tests should make REAL API calls to verify the CLI works correctly with the actual API
- Do NOT use unittest.mock, requests-mock, or any mocking libraries
- The goal is to verify your CLI can successfully interact with the real API

CRITICAL: You MUST provide BOTH files in your response. Provide the complete code for both files using markdown code blocks:
1. First code block: cli_tool.py - The CLI tool implementation
2. Second code block: test_cli_tool.py - The pytest tests

Format your response with two Python code blocks like this:
```python
# cli_tool.py code here
```

```python
# test_cli_tool.py code here
```

Do NOT use file creation tools. Use markdown code blocks only.

[ROUND_2_WITH_DOCS]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

Here is the API documentation:
{documentation_url}

The CLI tool should:

2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Follow the API documentation for proper usage

[ROUND_3_WITH_POSTMAN]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

Here is the API documentation:
{documentation_url}

Here is a Postman collection for the API:
{postman_collection_url}

The CLI tool should:
1. Accept command-line arguments for the API parameters
2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Follow the API documentation for proper usage
6. Use the Postman collection as a reference for API endpoints and parameters
7. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of the file

Also write comprehensive pytest tests for your CLI tool. The tests should:
1. Test the main functionality by calling the REAL API with valid inputs
2. Test error handling with invalid inputs (if safe to do so)
3. Verify that the CLI correctly parses and displays real API responses

[ROUND_4_WITH_EXAMPLES]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

Here is the API documentation:
{documentation_url}

Here is a Postman collection for the API:
{postman_collection_url}

Here is an example of how to use the API:
{example_prompt_url}

The CLI tool should:
1. Accept command-line arguments for the API parameters
2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Follow the API documentation for proper usage
6. Use the Postman collection as a reference for API endpoints and parameters
7. Follow the example usage patterns provided
8. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of the file

Also write comprehensive pytest tests for your CLI tool. The tests should:
1. Test the main functionality by calling the REAL API with valid inputs
2. Test error handling with invalid inputs (if safe to do so)
3. Verify that the CLI correctly parses and displays real API responses
4. DO NOT use mocks or fake data - call the actual API endpoints
