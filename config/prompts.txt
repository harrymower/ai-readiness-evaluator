[ROUND_1_CURL_ONLY]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

The CLI tool should:
1. Accept command-line arguments for the API parameters
2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of the file

Also write comprehensive pytest tests for your CLI tool. The tests should:
1. Test the main functionality with valid inputs
2. Test error handling with invalid inputs
3. Mock the API calls to avoid external dependencies
4. Achieve good code coverage
5. Include ALL necessary imports (pytest, unittest.mock, requests, etc.)

IMPORTANT: Make sure to include ALL imports needed for the code to run. Do not assume any imports are already present.

Create two files:
1. cli_tool.py - The CLI tool implementation
2. test_cli_tool.py - The pytest tests

Use the file creation tools to write these files to the current working directory.

[ROUND_3_WITH_POSTMAN]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

Here is the API documentation:
{documentation_url}

Here is a Postman collection for the API:
{postman_collection_url}

The CLI tool should:
1. Accept command-line arguments for the API parameters
2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Follow the API documentation for proper usage
6. Use the Postman collection as a reference for API endpoints and parameters
7. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of the file

Also write comprehensive pytest tests for your CLI tool. The tests should:
1. Test the main functionality with valid inputs
2. Test error handling with invalid inputs
3. Mock the API calls to avoid external dependencies

[ROUND_4_WITH_EXAMPLES]
Build a Python CLI tool that calls this API:

{curl_command}

Here is the API documentation:
{documentation_url}

Here is a Postman collection for the API:
{postman_collection_url}

Here is an example of how to use the API:
{example_prompt_url}

The CLI tool should:
1. Accept command-line arguments for the API parameters
2. Make the API call using the curl command as a reference
3. Parse and display the response in a user-friendly format
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Follow the API documentation for proper usage
6. Use the Postman collection as a reference for API endpoints and parameters
7. Follow the example usage patterns provided
8. Include ALL necessary imports at the top of the file

Also write comprehensive pytest tests for your CLI tool. The tests should:
1. Test the main functionality with valid inputs
2. Test error handling with invalid inputs
3. Mock the API calls to avoid external dependencies
4. Achieve good code coverage
5. Include ALL necessary imports (pytest, unittest.mock, requests, etc.)
